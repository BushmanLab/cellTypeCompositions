Description: Estimate cell type compositions from a table of clone
      by cell type counts. Functions are provided for exploring the cell
      type compositions that are displayed by cell lineages.  The
      workhorse is a function that performs blocked Gibbs sampling on the
      cell type frequencies in a parent population under a model that
      assumes a vague prior for the total number of cells and a uniform
      Dirichlet prior for the proportions fo different cell types.
